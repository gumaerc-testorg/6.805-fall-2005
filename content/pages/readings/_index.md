## Other Sources of General Course Material

- {{% resource_link "5638c4aa-3d00-4d0c-8ba1-9141e5578c94" "*Wired* Magazine" %}} displays the Gucci look for cyberspace (and Hal wrote this **before** they were purchased by Cond√©-Nast), with almost as many fonts per issue as the MIT Admissions Office's publicity booklet. You'll have to dig up more serious material for the course, but *Wired* is OK for general reading and there are occasional excellent articles.
- {{% resource_link "ad849568-bbed-4e8a-beea-8a6a70c39bcc" "The Electronic Frontier Foundation" %}} maintains extensive on-line {{% resource_link "ad849568-bbed-4e8a-beea-8a6a70c39bcc" "archives" %}}. These will be useful throughout the semester, especially the collections on {{% resource_link "e453f9b9-2aac-4ba4-8b33-e8d491a97754" "Legislation" %}} and {{% resource_link "7cb3bfee-4b63-415b-b874-ecfa4475aa60" "Legal" %}} issues, and the {{% resource_link "fb725727-a645-4c77-9759-f3132473559b" "Privacy, Security, Crypto, and Surveillance Archive" %}}. You should also check out current and past issues of their newsletter, the {{% resource_link "f7a2ded7-cb78-4dd3-a156-1e29cff15394" "EFFector" %}}.
- The {{% resource_link "aac66f87-86a2-4028-b8a1-e81fc3843492" "Center for Democracy and Technology" %}} is an organization concerned with civil liberties in computer and communications technologies. Their home page is a good place to look for information on current legislative action.
- The {{% resource_link "f943def1-89e9-4aca-bd64-42b827d23c19" "Electronic Privacy Information Center" %}} is a public-interest group that deals with civil liberty issues relating to the National Information Infrastructure. It is also the Washington Office of Privacy International. There are good on-line collections on {{% resource_link "71a15b98-d986-4aca-9295-30666bd78c75" "computer security" %}}, {{% resource_link "00388d85-05ff-423f-b7aa-b3a6a3b71d15" "privacy" %}}, {{% resource_link "4f103c8b-668b-45e3-82c0-7c0ab73c237b" "cryptography policy" %}}, and {{% resource_link "1d649fd7-12bd-4adb-ab32-0d1a4e0c721a" "free speech" %}}.

Subscriptions to Lexis/Nexis are licensed by institutions and are restricted. The links to Lexis/Nexis resources in this archive work at MIT only -- they can be accessed only from within the MIT network. Other people who wish to get hold of the Lexis/Nexis material cited in this archive will need to arrange for their own access.
- The U.S. Congress public information system provides keyword searches of the {{% resource_link "b20aa3c2-8898-49e9-aef8-cb7e25f444cc" "Congressional Record" %}}.
- Here are two classic science-fiction works that don't have anything to do with the course directly -- or maybe they have everything to do with the course directly, since they describe the futures we may be laying the groundwork for with today's network technology. Food for thought:
    - Gibson, William. *Neuromancer*. From the man who invented the word "cyberspace." If you've read the book and liked it, you may want to look at the sequels, *Count Zero* and *Mona Lisa Overdrive*.
    - Vinge, Vernor. "True Names." in the collection *True Names and other Dangers*. Written in the early 80s, this short story is frighteningly prophetic of current issues having to do with anonymity, privacy, and security on the network.
